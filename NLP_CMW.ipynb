However, it's not very useful to invent a new name for each individual preference. Therefore we as a society have come up with a way of grouping sexual preferences in a very rough way: we indicate to which gender the people belong for which we have a preference. We chose this because this is in most cases the largest common denominator. If a man is heterosexual it doesn't mean he has a preference for *all* women, it just means that all people you're attracted to are female.

In a quick (and probably inaccurate nutshell)  Objective morality is a belief that there are absolute moral truths although we humans might not always know what they are. Example include Cruelty for its own sake is wrong, parents ought to care for their children, compassion is a virtue, etc. \n",
            "\n",
            "2: Moral relativism means that going against a culture is immoral. One of the big logic problems happens when you consider trying to change a culture.  Trying to change a culture is immoral...right up until the culture changes, and then suddenly your action becomes moral.   This inconsistency makes morality meaningless in Moral Relativism.  For example, it would be immoral to be an abolisionist in a cultures that predominately holds slavery to be moral. The actions of an abolisionist trying to oppose slaving and change the culture are immoral...except that when the culture changes, now its the abolisionist that is moral.  \n",

            "By your suggestion that the past shouldn't be judged by todays morality, that would put us in a logic conundrum where the leaders who defined our current morality, must be judged as immoral by using the past standards. Meaning that all moral actions are actually born from immoral actions that are the exact same action. When the defining of morality becomes this flexible it make morality meaningless and cause morality to lose value in being any sort of code to live by.\n",

Pascals wager fails because whatever you believe in the supernatural, there is as much possibility of any belief or combination of beliefs fulfilling the standard for heaven or hell as there is for any other belief or combination of beliefs.\n",
            "\n",
            "Christianity that threatens something of someone else certainly holds together that part but some of it is probably held together for people who explicitly don't believe in hell. Sure, many if not most forms of Christianity believe in hell, but a lot of individualized and probably some institutionalized forms do not believe in hell, and those forms of Christianity are not held together by fear. And since all a priori arguments for any form of Christianity are equally logically invalid , and all a posteriori arguments are as lacking in evidence of their occurrence and parsimoniousness in their explanation of reality, so good Christianity has no less of a basis to be convincing as bad Christianity. Of course, bad Christianity has no MORE of a basis to be convincing as good Christianity, and that is why I am fiercely secular in my demands for justifications of social behavior, because if there are no reasonable standards for logic and evidence as to why you ought to do something, then you can justify anything. But if you also share this expectation, then your Christianity is basically harmless to anyone but yourself, and it is a risk of personal harm that you ought to be allowed to take of your own volition. And if that personal belief does not include hell or purgatory, then it is not held together by fear, even if most/all others are.\n",

            "Morality is the same. Morality is the question of how you should act based on your values, and your values are the axioms of this system. Just like the axioms in math, the values you select are largely arbitrary, and having different values will give rise to different moral systems. Once you've established a moral system, you can make some pretty objective statements about what is moral and what is not. But you can do this in mathematics too. In one system of mathematics you can objectively state that 1+1=2 and in another system it's not true.\n",

I understand the gospels have been debated on their canon relevance and the council got to pick and choose what went into the bible, but here we are in the end with... a bible. The bible that Christians claim to accept the authority of. The relevance of the canon has already been debated in the past and here you are with your holy book to which you claim to follow, and claim has authority. Christians then, after saying \"yes, the bible is correct and I follow the authority of the bible and it's teachings\" (especially the ones that can be quoted saying they believe and follow it \"cover to cover\") will still be able to believe and not believe the bible? follow and not follow it? Does every Christian who practices their religion do so with some sneaky fine-print? Yes, you can command someone and they may not listen, but these are the people who claim to be listening. They say they're listening to something that's already been debated, to something they've already claimed has some divine authority.

Most instances of rape involve either the threat of physical violence or physical violence, but there are some instances of rape that necessitate neither of those factors. I googled the definition of rape, and it actually really upsets me that physical violence or the threat of it is a defining factor of rape. It invalidates the experience of people who have definitely been raped but the violence or threats of violence never happened. It makes them question whether or not their experience is worthy of what they are feeling. Society tells victims that if they didn’t say “no” then it isn’t rape. We know that there are many reason why a victim might not say “no” though. Society often tells victims that if they didn’t fight back then it isn’t rape. So society is essentially telling victims that if they didn’t do everything they could to escalate the danger of the situation for themselves, then they weren’t raped. If you can’t even figure out whether or not you were raped because of the way society has chosen to frame or re-frame something that has happened to you, then it is going to be much harder for you to process the trauma. \n",

Since ultimately God is the arbiter of what is \"really good\", then you are gonna operate within that construct.

Well, if the public transportation system is losing money, then where is the money going to come from to pay these extra employees? Even if fairs were increased, with such lower ridership late at night they would have to be increased to the point that people wouldn't bother using public transportation unless they absolutely have to in order for the public transit system to break even, or the extra money would have to come from taxes which then means that people are paying for a service through taxes that really isn't needed.\n",
